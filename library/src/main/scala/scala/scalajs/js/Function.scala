/**
 * The Function constructor creates a new Function object. In JavaScript every
 * function is actually a Function object.
 *
 * Function objects created with the Function constructor are parsed when the
 * function is created. This is less efficient than declaring a function and calling
 * it within your code, because functions declared with the function statement
 * are parsed with the rest of the code.
 *
 * All arguments passed to the function are treated as the names of the
 * identifiers of the parameters in the function to be created, in the order
 * in which they are passed.
 *
 * Note: Functions created with the Function constructor do not create closures
 * to their creation contexts; they always are created in the global scope.
 * When running them, they will only be able to access their own local
 * variables and global ones, not the ones from the scope in which the Function
 * constructor was called. This is different from using eval with code for
 * a function expression.
 *
 * Invoking the Function constructor as a function (without using the new
 * operator) has the same effect as invoking it as a constructor.
